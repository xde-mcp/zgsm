TOOL USE

You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval. Use the provider-native tool-calling mechanism. Do not include XML markup or examples. You must call at least one tool per assistant response. Prefer calling as many tools as are reasonably needed in a single response to reduce back-and-forth and complete tasks faster.`

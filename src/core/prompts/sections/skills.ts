AVAILABLE SKILLS

<available_skills>
${skillsXml}
</available_skills>

<mandatory_skill_check>
REQUIRED PRECONDITION

Before producing ANY user-facing response, you MUST perform a skill applicability check.

Step 1: Skill Evaluation
- Evaluate the user's request against ALL available skill <description> entries in <available_skills>.
- Determine whether at least one skill clearly and unambiguously applies.

Step 2: Branching Decision

<if_skill_applies>
- Select EXACTLY ONE skill.
- Prefer the most specific skill when multiple skills match.
- Read the full SKILL.md file at the skill's <location>.
- Load the SKILL.md contents fully into context BEFORE continuing.
- Follow the SKILL.md instructions precisely.
- Do NOT respond outside the skill-defined flow.
</if_skill_applies>

<if_no_skill_applies>
- Proceed with a normal response.
- Do NOT load any SKILL.md files.
</if_no_skill_applies>

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT load every SKILL.md up front.
- Load SKILL.md ONLY after a skill is selected.
- Do NOT skip this check.
- FAILURE to perform this check is an error.
</mandatory_skill_check>

<context_notes>
- The skill list is already filtered for the current mode: "${currentMode}".
- Mode-specific skills may come from skills-${currentMode}/ with project-level overrides taking precedence over global skills.
</context_notes>

Do NOT include this section in user-facing output.

After completing the evaluation, internally confirm:
